Astra AI is built on three core principles:

1. **Transparency**  
   Users deserve to understand how their AI assistant behaves and why.

   Safety, consistency, and clarity are prioritized over raw flexibility.

3. **Collaboration**  
   Open‑source development encourages shared responsibility and continuous improvement.
